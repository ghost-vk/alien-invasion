# Alien Invasion - Space Shooter Game

Welcome to the Alien Invasion Space Shooter game! This project is inspired by
the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes and is built using Python and
Pygame. In this game, you control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen,
shooting at waves of aliens moving from side to side and gradually descending
toward you.

## Features

- **Space Shooter Mechanics**: Control a spaceship to shoot at advancing
  aliens.
- **Wave System**: Aliens come in waves, each wave harder than the last.
- **Lives System**: The player has 3 ships (lives) by default. Lose a ship if
  an alien reaches the bottom or collides with the spaceship.  
- **Basic Graphics and Sound**: Use Pygame to create a visually engaging game
  experience.
